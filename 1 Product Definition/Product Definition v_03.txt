Arduino DDS Tone Shield Definition




Introduction
There is currently no easy way to achieve a tone sign wave using the current arduno uno rev 3 board. This project looks to become an accessory to the Arduino Uno board that will generate a tone by utilizing A direct digital snythesizer in conjunction with a low pass chebyshev filter. Additionally the board will have a wireless connection that allows a phone to send information to the board, and allow a user to adjust the audio. The board also has a 3 band equalizer that allows a user to filter specific frequency regions of the the audio spectrum by hand.

	+ Idle State

	+ Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State

	+ Manual Frequency Signal Driven State

	+ Eq switch off

	+ Eq switch on

	+ Off State




Detailed Behavior
   State: Initial State
       Arduino Uno power on
      	   # Blink State indicator three times to confirm operational power	
          	  # Play one tone for one second to confirm functionality of speaker
             	 	# Check state status for operational state
                  	 	 # Change state indicator light to comply with the state
				 # If manual state indicator is chosen, generate signal in accordance to Variable Frequency Controller
					# If manual state indicator is not chosen, open up communication port to arduino uno to recieve instructions on standby

   State: Idle State 
       Micro Controller is set to Idle
            # Scan for change in State change indicator
		# Wait to recieve instructions from Arduino Uno

   State: Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State
       Input is being recieved
            # PWM out to drive speaker based on observed input from Arduino
                # Check for change in state change indicator every milisecond
                    # Check for aditional signal commands from arduino uno every milisecond
			# If no aditional commands recieved, stop generating additional pwm driven signals to speaker and change to Idle State
                
   State: Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
       The State Switch has been activated
            # Check to see if State Switch has been deactivated
		# If State switch is deactivated, return to idle state
		# If state Switch Activated, drive speaker with pwm signal and repeat test of state switch activation

   State: Eq switch off
	The State Switch has been deactivated
	    # Signal is forwarded from the from Chebyshev Low Pass filter to Attenuator.

   State: Eq switch on
	The State Switch has been activated
	    # Signal is forwarded from the from Chebyshev Low Pass filter to the 3 band eq. then the Attenuator.
	    	# Signal is altered based on the EQ. settings.

   State: Off 
       Unplugged from Arduino
            # Nothing happens
