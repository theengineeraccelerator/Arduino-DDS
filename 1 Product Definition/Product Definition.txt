Arduino DDS Tone Shield Definition


Introduction
There is currently no easy way to achieve a tone sign wave using the current arduino uno rev 3 board. This project looks to become an accessory to the Arduino Uno board that will generate a tone by utilizing A direct digital synthesizer in conjunction with a low pass chebyshev filter. Additionally the board will have a wireless connection that allows a phone to send information to the board, and allow a user to adjust the audio. The board also has a 3 band equalizer that allows a user to filter specific frequency regions of the the audio spectrum by hand.
