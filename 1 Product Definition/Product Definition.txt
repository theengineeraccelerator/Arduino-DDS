Arduino DDS Tone Shield Definition


Introduction
There is currently no easy way to achieve a tone sine wave using the current arduino uno rev 3 board, this project looks to become an accessory to the Arduino Uno board that will generate a tone.

Utilizing A direct digital synthesizer the board completes this. Additionally the board has the ability to switch between multiple signal sources, as well as put the tone signal through a low pass chebyshev filter and 3 band equalizer to allow a user to filter specific frequency regions of the the audio spectrum by hand.
